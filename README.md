## SAMBA
An international scientific meeting bringing together researchers and practitioners working in symbolic AI.
- Exchange and discussion of state-of-the-art techniques and emerging ideas
- Presentation of real-world, industry-driven challenges
- Foster collaboration with Brazilian and international universities, research centers, and companies

## Why SAMBA Matters
Modern scientific knowledge is built on the rigorous generation and analysis of experimental data:
- Formulate clear hypotheses
- Collect and curate data
### Model phenomena using mathematical and symbolic representations
Iterate: analyze, understand, refine, and repeat
#### Understanding the AI model itself is essential:
- To validate and trust solutions
- To adapt models to specific domains and constraints
- To gain insight into the underlying phenomena being studied
